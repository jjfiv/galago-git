Building Galago

Java and Maven Requirements:

    Java JDK 1.8.0 or later (http://java.sun.com)
    Maven 3.0 or later (http://maven.apache.org)


    In order to install the drmaa dependency run the scipt:
      ./scripts/installlib.sh

    Type 'mvn package' at the command line to build the projects.  
    The build process will run all the unit tests.  If you prefer to work from 
    an IDE, Eclipse, IntelliJ and NetBeans have Maven plugins.

    For the first build, do a full 'mvn package' or 'mvn install'.  A basic
    compile will not succeed due to missing dependencies.

    If you feel like skipping the tests, add in '-DskipTests' to any mvn command.

    To run the application on Unix:
      ./core/target/appassembler/bin/galago

    To run the application including contrib libs and classes:
      ./contrib/target/appassembler/bin/galago

    Make sure the scripts have execute permissions on Linux machines.
      chmod a+x ./core/target/appassembler/bin/galago*
