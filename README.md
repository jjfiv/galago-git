# Galago

There is a quick start guide on the wiki: [Quick Guide for New Users](https://sourceforge.net/p/lemur/wiki/Galago:%20Quick%20Guide%20for%20New%20Users/)

## Is this the Galago from the Text Book I have?

No, that version is older and preserved here: [The Book Version](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/downloads/SearchEnginesGalagoCode/)
